# ros-multi-agent-mission-coordination
Implementation of a multi-robot mission coordination system using ROS1 and Gazebo, where three differential-drive robots autonomously navigate toward their assigned flags while avoiding collisions. Includes timing-based strategies, PID-inspired goal approach, ultrasonic sensing, odometry processing, and robust multi-agent behavior design.
